Extending papermill by contributing to it
=========================================

If you find that you'd like to not only add I/O and execution handlers, but
think a fundamental aspect of the project could use some improvement, then you
may want to contribute to it.

Development of papermill happens on github, and a
`detailed guide to contributing`_ to it can be found there. There is also a
`code of conduct`_ there. Please read both documents before beginning!
