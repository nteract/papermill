**Papermill** is a tool for parameterizing and executing Jupyter Notebooks.

Papermill lets you:

*   **parameterize** notebooks
*   **execute** notebooks

This opens up new opportunities for how notebooks can be used. For example:

- Perhaps you have a financial report that you wish to run with different
  values on the first or last day of a month or at the beginning or end
  of the year, **using parameters** makes this task easier.
- Do you want to run a notebook and depending on its results,
  choose a particular notebook to run next? You can now programmatically
  **execute a workflow** without having to copy and paste from notebook to
  notebook manually.

Python Version Support
----------------------

This library currently supports python 3.6+ versions. As minor python
versions are officially sunset by the python org papermill will similarly
drop support in the future.
