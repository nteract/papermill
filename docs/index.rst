**Papermill** is a tool for parameterizing, executing, and analyzing Jupyter
Notebooks.

Papermill lets you:

* **parameterize** notebooks
* **execute** and **collect** metrics across the notebooks
* **summarize collections** of notebooks

This opens up new opportunities for how notebooks can be used. For example:

- Perhaps you have a financial report that you wish to run with different
  values on the first or last day of a month or at the beginning or end
  of the year, **using parameters** makes this task easier.
- Do you want to run a notebook and depending on its results,
  choose a particular notebook to run next? You can now programmatically
  **execute a workflow** without having to copy and paste from notebook to
  notebook manually.
- Do you have plots and visualizations spread across 10 or more notebooks?
  Now you can choose which plots to programmatically display a **summary**
  **collection** in a notebook to share with others.
