## 2.1.0

- Support for python 3.5 has been dropped. Upstream library changes for async were causing process deadlocks with await commands. End-of-life is later this year for 3.5 anyway so we decided to also drop support here.
- Error cells injected at the top of failed notebooks look nicer now as markdown.

## 2.0.0

Papermill 2.0 has a number of awesome features from many different contributors. We used the major version change mostly to signify the change to Python 3 only, but we also allowed for PRs which has small interaction changes to also be made. No major functionality should change with this release, but many minor improvements might impact specific execution patterns. We'll keep an eye on issues and post bug fixes ASAP if any of these cause larger unexpected issues.

### Features

- Papermill is now Python 3.5+ only!
- [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is no longer a dependency of papermill, instead the smaller and newly released [nbclient](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is now the execution dependency.
- Support added for parameterizing C# kernels
- Support added for parameterizing F# kernels
- `sys.exit(0)` now respected by papermill
- Python parameters are now black formatted (in python versions >= 3.6)
- Notebook documents are saved periodically now rather than solely on cell completion.
- A cell `--execute-timeout` option was added.
- HDFS io support added with `hdfs://` scheme (with `papermill[hdfs]` install).

### Fixes

- Fixed metadata writing on markdown and raw cells to follow v4.4 schema correctly
- Azure Blob Storage support fixed for newer blob storage. `azure-storage-blob >= 12.1.0` is now supported, older version support was dropped.
- IOPub timeouts now raise an exception instead of a warning.

### Interaction Changes (more details)

- [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) dependency has been replaced with [nbclient](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This means the default engine is now `nbclient` rather than `nbconvert` and the NBConvertEngine class no longer exists. This may mean extensions that extended this class will need to be updated slightly to the new class.
- `sys.exit(0)` in python kernels now transfers exit code to papermill, meaning papermill will gracefully stop the notebook execution and not raise an exception to the user. `sys.exit(1)` or other exceptions still raise as expected and change the status code from 0 for the papermill process.
- When generating parameters for python (when running on 3.6+) the parameters will be printed more cleanly with a pass of [black](https://github.com/psf/black) before injecting into the notebook.
- Older Azure Blob Storage support was dropped: `azure-storage-blob < 12.1.0`
- The `--autosave-cell-every` option now controls the minimum time between notebook saves during cell execution. This time will exponentially backoff if it takes more than 25% of the autosave-cell-every value. Setting `--autosave-cell-every` to `0` disabled this feature.
- The `--execute-timeout` option can be set to enable a per-cell execution timeout limit.
- IOPub timeouts used to only warn and attempt to continue execution. This can be triggered by printing '0' in a wide for-loop without any sleeps. The side-effect of best-effort execution was that outputs and failures could be lost in the IOPub timeout event and notebooks would "succeed" when they were actually failing. We chose to change this pattern from a warning to an error for papermill. To fix the issue when it occurs you need to delay the number of print or display messages per second being produced in your notebooks.

## 1.2.1

- Importing papermill no longer manipulates `yaml.SafeLoader` globally
- Parameters with leading `_` now have prefix `_` stripped before passing to R kernels
- A few documentation typos were fixed

## 1.2.0

- Parameters lists passing feature from 1.1.0 was removed due to cli api issues it caused.
- Piping papermill into nbconvert no longer triggers an encoding error on Python 2
- Added `BOTO3_ENDPOINT_URL` environment variable to override boto session url
- stdout / stderr can now be streamed to a file via `--stdout-file /dev/stdout` and `--stderr-file /dev/stderr`.
- The CLI option `--not-report-mode` is now `--no-report-mode`
- GCFS connectors should now retry under all conditions that the upstream library defines as retryable. Papermill now uses the is_retryable method from the upstream dependency.

## 1.1.0 (This version should be avoided for several known issues fixed in 1.2.0)

- Read content from stdin/to stdout when the path is `-` or a pipe. This allows for `<generate input>... | papermill | ...<process output>`, with `papermill - -` being implied by the pipes.
- The built-in `ADLHandler` for Azure Pipelines should now work properly again.
- Many documentation improvements
- IPython is now lazily imported only when progress bars are needed.
- A MATLAB translator is now available for parameters being passed to MATLAB notebooks.
- Parameters lists can more easily be passed to the command line via: `-p name value1 value2 3 ...` which results in adding to notebooks a parameter list assignment `name = ["value1", "value2", 3]`.

## 1.0.1

- Cleaned up some dependency and build issues around pip 19 and pandas
- `execute_notebook` can now take notebook as strings instead of only as a path
- `kwargs` are now passed through the default engine to nbconvert's wrapper class
- Passing dates through yaml as parameters will no longer raise an exception (i.e. `-y "a_date: 2019-01-01"` without having to quote ala `-y "a_date: '2019-01-01'"`)

## 1.0.0

We made it to our [1.0 milestone goals](https://github.com/nteract/papermill/milestone/1?closed=1)! The largest change here is removal of `record`, `Notebook`, and `NotebookCollection` abstractions which are now living in [scrapbook](https://github.com/nteract/scrapbook) and requirement of nbconvert 5.5 as a dependency.

- Input and output paths can now reference input parameters. `my_nb_{nb_type}.ipynb out_{nb_type}.ipynb -p nb_type test` will substitute values into the paths passed in with python format application patterns.
- `read_notebook`, `read_notebooks`, `record`, and `display` api functions are now removed.
- \[upstream\] ipywidgets are now supported. See [nbconvert docs](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute_api.html#widget-state) for details.
- \[upstream\] notebook executions which run out of memory no longer hang indefinitely when the kernel dies.

## 0.19.1

- Added a warning when no `parameter` tag is present but parameters are being passed
- Replaced `retry` with `tenacity` to help with conda builds and to use a non-abandoned library

## 0.19.0

**DEPRECATION CHANGE** The record, read_notebook, and read_notebooks functions
are now officially deprecated and will be removed in papermill 1.0.

- scrapbook functionality is now deprecated
- gcsfs support is expanded to cover recent releases

## 0.18.2

### Fixes

- Addressed an issue with reading encoded notebook .ipynb files in python 3.5

## 0.18.1

### Fixes

- azure missing environment variable now has a better error message and only fails lazily
- gcs connector now has a backoff to respect service rate limits

## 0.18.0

**INSTALL CHANGE** The iorw extensions now use optional dependencies.
This means that installation for s3, azure, and gcs connectors are added via:

```bash
pip install papermill[s3,azure,gcs]
```

or for all dependencies

```bash
pip install papermill[all]
```

### Features

- Optional IO extensions are now separated into different dependencies.
- Added gs:// optional dependency for google cloud storage support.
- null json fields in parmaeters now translate correctly to equivilent fields in each supported language

### Fixes

- tqdm dependencies are pinned to fetch a minimum version for auto tqdm

### Dev Improvements

- Releases and versioning patterns were made easier
- Tox is now used to capture all test and build requirements

## 0.17.0

### Features

- Log level can now be set with `--log-level`
- The working directory of papermill can be set with the `--cwd` option. This will set the executing context of the kernel but not impact input/output paths. `papermill --cwd foo bar/input_nb.ipynb bar/output_nb.ipynb` would make the notebook able to reference files in the `foo` directoy without `../foo` but still save the output notebook in the `bar` directory.
- Tox has been added for testing papermill. This makes it easier to catch linting and manifest issues without waiting for a failed Travis build.

### Fixes

- Fixed warnings for reading non-ipynb files
- Fixed `--report-mode` with parameters (and made it more compatible with JupyterLab)
- Papermill execution progress bars now render within a notebook correctly after importing seaborn
- The `--prepare-only` option no longer requires that kernels be installed locally (you can parameterize a notebook without knowing how to execute it)
- Azure IO adapter now correctly prefixes paths with the `adl://` scheme
- Tests on OSX should pass again

### Docs

- Install doc improvements
- Guide links are updated in the README
- Test docs updated for tox usage
